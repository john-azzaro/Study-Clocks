Process
==========================

1. Create the basic clock layout.
    o   Since this is going to be an analog clock, so it will have:
        o   Hour hand
        o   Minute hand
        o   Second hand
        o   Clock body
        o   Hour numbers

    o   Create a div for the clock clock itself
    o   Within the clock div, create divs for each one of the components above.
    o   For each element, create two classes: type (e.g. hand or number) and the specific element (e.g. hour, minute, second). 

2. Style class:
    o   Default values
    o   body background
    o   clock stylization
        o   use of absolute/relative positioning for clock elements in relation to the clock itself.
        o
